// things it cannot restore are exactly the two you are looking at: the playhead
// (it forced frame 1) and the RENDERED preview, which is client state, so the
// box fell back to the raw frame. Coming back from the terminal therefore
// looked like the preview had reset itself.

// it there is nothing left to restore from. The TTL is what sessionStorage was
// buying — a view from days ago is not "where I was".
