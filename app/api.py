    `mapping[rank]` is the source faceset index chosen for target person `rank`,
    so the swap can address a source by person rank. Returns None when there is
    no mapping (the caller then uses INPUT_FACESETS as-is).

    Not every swap mode addresses sources by person. "All input faces" walks the
    detected faces and the source list in lockstep by POSITION — its whole
    contract is "one input face per detected face, in gallery order" — so a
    person-ordered list is meaningless to it and, worse, is only as long as the
    number of captured people: with three sources loaded and one person
    captured it silently swapped one face instead of three. That mode therefore
    opts out and keeps the gallery order. The modes that DO use the mapping are
    "Selected face" (indexes by person rank) and the single-source modes (whose
    gallery index is translated by mapped_selected_index below).

    This returns a NEW list and never touches roop_globals.INPUT_FACESETS. An
    earlier version swapped the global out for the duration of the swap and
    restored it afterwards — but a swap holds that window for seconds (preview)
    to minutes (a run), and /api/source/* mutates the same global from another
    thread. An upload landing inside the window appended to the temporary list
    and was then thrown away by the restore, while its thumbnail (a separate
    list) survived: the gallery showed the new face but the backend no longer
    had it, so that person swapped with an empty faceset — i.e. stayed
    un-swapped — until the face was removed and re-added outside the window.

# from a frontal angle, so these have to stay loose or the bank ends up holding
# only near-frontal angles and the person stops being recognised the moment they
# turn. Wrong-person capture is prevented by the relative cross-person checks at
# the call sites, not by these absolute cutoffs.

_ANGLE_SEED_MAX   = float(os.environ.get('ROOP_ANGLE_SEED_MAX', '0.85'))    # /target/auto_angles

# ── Auto-angles intake, for the frames where the relative guards go silent ───
# The cross-person and runner-up checks in consider_frame are RELATIVE, which is
# why they can be strict without punishing a hard pose. But both need a second
# face to compare against: the runner-up check is literally `len(scored) > 1`,
# and the cross-person one needs ANOTHER captured person. On a frame holding one
# face — thousands of them in a long clip, and by definition every frame where
# the target has walked off — neither can run, and the only things left are two
# absolute distances against the target's own bank.
#
# A typical stranger (0.93-1.07 measured) fails those. What crosses them is a
# DEGRADED frame, where the embedding collapses toward the middle of the space
# and lands near everybody. Hence the two gates below, which cost nothing on a
# clean frame:
#
#   BLUR_FRAC / MIN_PX / MIN_QUALITY — refuse to bank a blurred or tiny crop at
#     all. Judged on image quality only (face_quality.image_quality), never on
#     pose, or the gate would reject the profiles this feature exists to collect.
#
#     Blur is gated RELATIVE to what this clip actually offers — a candidate
#     less than BLUR_FRAC of the median sharpness of the faces scanned so far.
#     An absolute cutoff cannot work at both ends: measured on face-like crops,
#     a clean face scores 0.96-1.00 on the sharpness axis and a mildly blurred
#     one 0.03, but the numbers move wholesale with grain, compression and
#     focus, so a fixed line either passes everything on a crisp clip or rejects
#     everything on a soft one. The composite score cannot carry this either —
#     a heavily blurred 200px face still totals 0.505, because size and detector
#     confidence prop up exactly the frame whose embedding is worthless. Hence a
#     dedicated blur gate, with MIN_QUALITY left as a weak backstop.
#   LONE_ACCEPT — on those unguarded frames, require the face to be closer to
#     the bank than the usual ACCEPT. Deliberately tightens the BANK distance
#     rather than the seed distance: a genuine profile arrives by chaining, so
#     it sits near an intermediate angle already banked and its bank distance is
#     small, while a marginal admission sits out near the limit. Tightening the
#     seed distance instead would have hit the profiles hardest.
#
# Pollution matters more than one bad thumbnail: every swap-time gate takes the
# MINIMUM over a person's angles, so one wrong angle makes a stranger's whole
# track measure ~0 to that person and inherit their source.

# running face detection, and in the Extras case downloading models and doing
# whole-video inference — and awaits nothing at all. Declared `async`, each of
# them therefore held the single event loop for its entire duration, so while a
# file was being ingested NOTHING else async got served: the progress poll, the
# telemetry poll and the log feed all queued up behind it and the UI looked
# frozen. Sync `def` costs a threadpool hop and gives the loop back.

    Runs in two phases, both matching each frame's faces against the person's
    GROWING angle bank (so gradual turns chain: each newly-added angle extends
    coverage for the next):

      1. a coarse pass over evenly-spaced samples across the whole video, and
      2. a targeted refine pass that re-scans, at fine stride, only the
         intervals BETWEEN coarse samples whose pose changed.

    Phase 2 is what stops angles being missed. A head turn lasts well under a
    second, so at a coarse stride the profile frames fall between samples; but
    pose is continuous, so a pose that never landed on a sample must lie inside
    an interval whose endpoints differ. Spending the extra decode there — rather
    than on uniformly more frames, which mostly returns more of the same frontal
    look — is what finds the extremes. The intermediate angles it picks up also
    chain the bank outward, which is what lets a true profile pass ACCEPT at all.

    Budget is per pose BIN (see _pose_bin) rather than one global count, so easy
    frontal angles can no longer consume the whole allowance before the hard
    poses are reached. Wrong grabs (rare) are removable via the per-angle ✕ in
