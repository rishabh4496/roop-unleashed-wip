"""Which way up is this face, when the detector cannot tell you.

THE PROBLEM. Every orientation signal in this app is derived from the detected
keypoints, and on a face that is both turned to profile AND rolled past about
90 degrees the detector does not fail loudly — it finds the face, reports 0.99
confidence, and assigns the keypoints as though the head were oriented some
other way. Measured on a profile plate rolled to a true 101 degrees, the
eye->mouth midline reads -22.9. That is below `face_util.FACE_ROLL_LOWER`, so
`face_rotation_action` concludes the face is already upright and returns None,
and its "a trustworthy axis said upright, do not second-guess it" early return
stops the 106-point and bbox fallbacks from ever running. The swapper is then
handed an upside-down profile, and the swap collapses: identity against the
source falls to 0.10-0.18 where two DIFFERENT people score 0.13. Turning the
frame upright by hand restores it to 0.68-0.74.

WHY IT IS NOT FIXED FROM ONE FRAME. Measured on the same plates, none of the
obvious single-image discriminators survive contact:

  - detector confidence is 0.99-1.00 in all four quarter turns, so argmax over
    it picks nonsense (a level frontal face "prefers" being turned 90 degrees);
  - the 106-point midline and the 68-point 3-D midline fail on exactly the same
    frames as the 5 keypoints, because all three read the same bad detection;
  - rotating the frame four ways and taking the consensus of the keypoints
    mapped back disagrees with the truth about a third of the time.

The face is genuinely ambiguous to this detector in one frame. What is NOT
ambiguous is a sequence: roll is continuous, a head does not jump from 20
degrees to 200 between frames, and the estimate is reliable everywhere except
this one pocket. So the ambiguity is resolved along the track — predict the
roll from where it has been going, accept an observation that agrees, and coast
through the ones that do not.

The estimate is trusted again as soon as it agrees with the prediction, so a
track re-acquires rather than drifting forever on a stale rate.

    to 172 degrees wrong, while the 68-point midline stays within 5.4 degrees
    over a full turn. Duplicated rather than imported so this module stays free
    of face_util, which is the module it exists to correct.

    Within the 68-point landmarks, the nose-bridge-to-chin midline (27->8) is
    preferred over the eye-to-mouth axis (36:48/48/54) when both eyes are
    available to compare them: the eye axis needs BOTH eyes located reliably,
    and the far eye is exactly what a yaw turn starts occluding/mislocating —
    the nose bridge and chin are midline points, visible from either side, so
    they keep tracking the head's true vertical axis well past where the eye
    pair starts drifting. Measured on a real profile+inverted clip (roop-recode,
    2026-08-15): the eye-mouth axis was already 11 degrees off true roll by the
    time the nose-chin axis was still within 1 degree, extending reliable
    tracking by roughly 10 more frames before yaw got extreme enough to corrupt
    both together. Falls back to the eye-mouth axis when the nose/chin points
    are degenerate (e.g. a synthetic fixture that never set them) or the model
