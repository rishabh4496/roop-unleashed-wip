# clear mismatches, not a re-selection, so a blurred or turned frame of the

# clip while different people sat at ~0.93-1.07, so 0.85 separates them.

#
# That reasoning holds for a lone subject, but it leaves one hole: if the
# TRACKER itself switches identity — two people cross, or one leaves and another

# these constants were tuned on, so ~1.0 vetoes strangers while leaving even a

# ── Re-ID (appearance-only) association gate ─────────────────────────────────
# The tracking scan associates a detection to a track on TWO kinds of evidence:
# spatial continuity (IoU against the track's predicted box) AND appearance
# (<= _TRACK_EMB_MAX). When the spatial half fails — occlusion, a fast turn, a
# face that left and came back — it falls back to Re-ID, which matches on
# appearance ALONE: no position, no recency, nothing else.
#
# Both stages used the same 0.7 bar, so the association with the LEAST evidence
# behind it was held to exactly the standard of the one with the most. Standard
# tracking-by-detection does the opposite (BoT-SORT/ByteTrack hold the fallback
# association stage to a stricter appearance threshold than the primary one),
# and the symmetric version is how an unselected face joined the target's track:
# somebody entering the shot for the first time has no track of their own to win
# the nearest-match comparison, so the single 0.7 is all that stands between
# them and the target's (by then retired) track. Different people normally
# measure 0.93-1.07, but a profile or a motion-blurred frame drops well under
# 0.7. Once absorbed they inherit the target's source for every frame they
# appear in, and with one selected person NO swap-time veto runs to catch it.
#
# 0.5 is not a new number: it is the bar the track already applies to its own
# observations before letting one update emb_mean. A detection too far off to
# inform an identity should not be able to claim one with no spatial evidence.
#
# SCOPE — this applies ONLY to Re-ID against a RETIRED track (unseen for STALE
# frames). A track seen within STALE frames keeps _TRACK_EMB_MAX, because
# recency is itself evidence and because the faces that reach Re-ID with a
# recently-seen track are the occluded/blurred/partially-detected ones this
# tracker exists to carry. Applying the tighter bar to those was the earlier
# draft of this fix: it breaks an occluded face out into a track of its own, and
# a swap that blinks off whenever an object or another face crosses the subject
# is the exact regression _TRACK_VETO_SINGLE was reverted for. The bar follows
# the evidence, and an occlusion has plenty of it.
#
# A refused Re-ID does not drop the face — it starts a track of its own, judged
# on its own mean by the source assignment, so a genuine re-acquisition still
# locks. The cost is more fragments; raise toward _TRACK_EMB_MAX if a target
# stops locking after re-entering a shot, and see the `[Track]` refusal count.

# ── Gap-fill continuity ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The temporal pre-pass fills a track's detection misses by LINEARLY
# INTERPOLATING between the two observations either side of the gap, and the
# only condition was that the gap be short enough (ROOP_TEMPORAL_GAP frames).
# Nothing checked that the two anchors were in the same PLACE.
#
# They need not be. The scan's primary association is IoU-gated so it cannot
# teleport, but the Re-ID fallback matches on embedding ALONE, with no spatial
# constraint at all — by design, since it exists to reconnect a face that left
# and came back. So a track can legitimately jump across the frame between two
# consecutive observations, and the gap-filler would then manufacture a face for
# every frame in between, sliding across whatever the background happens to be.
#
# Those manufactured faces are invisible to every identity check downstream:
# _interp_face sets their embedding to the TRACK MEAN, so their distance to the
# track is 0 (passes the appearance gate) and their distance to the captured
# target is the track's own (which already passed the assignment gate). They are
# swapped unconditionally, wherever they were placed — and because a source can
# only be used once per frame, the real face in that frame is then refused.
#
# So bridge a gap only when the face could plausibly have travelled between the
# anchors: at most this many face-widths per skipped frame, with a bounded size
# change. Generous by construction — a head crossing half its own width every
# frame is already fast motion. 0 disables the guard (pre-fix behaviour).

# ── Track → source assignment gate ───────────────────────────────────────────
# Binding a track to a source is a DURABLE decision: every face on that track,
# for as long as it runs, is swapped with no further identity check beyond the
# vetoes. It is also made from the track's MEAN embedding over every accepted
# observation — a far cleaner measurement than any single frame.
#
# It was gated on max_face_distance, the same threshold as per-frame matching.
# That threshold is deliberately loose because it has to carry one bad frame of
# the right person; applied to a mean it lets a track that merely resembles the
# target own the source for a whole stretch of frames. Measured: a real person's
# track mean sat at 0.36 while background/blur false detections clustered at
# 0.85-1.0 — i.e. exactly where a 0.75-0.85 threshold sits. A run of a 33k-frame
# clip bound 16 of its 81 tracks to the one selected person.
#
# A track refused here is not dropped: its frames fall through to per-frame
# matching at the full threshold, so a real face still swaps, just without
# identity locking. 0 restores the old behaviour (gate == max_face_distance).
_TRACK_ASSIGN_MAX = float(os.environ.get('ROOP_TRACK_ASSIGN_MAX', '0.6'))

# A track's MEAN can fail the gate above even when the track really is the
# selected person, if the track itself spans a long stretch of pose movement
# (a continuous turn, a stretch/exercise motion): the mean is an average over
# every pose the track saw, so it sits "between" all of them and close to
# none. Measured on a 15s single-continuous-shot yoga clip: the track's own
# individual per-frame observations matched the captured photo at 0.003-0.015
# on its first two frames, then the SAME physical track (confirmed by spatial
# continuity — see _TRACK_EMB_MAX at track-build time) sat at 0.85-1.05 for
# the rest, because the person kept moving through the stretch. The mean
# blurred those two strong hits away entirely and the whole track (masking
# ~70 frames until the pose happened to return near-frontal) got refused.
#
# Fix: if enough of a track's OWN individual observations independently
# match a captured angle within the assignment gate, that is strong direct
# evidence the WHOLE track is that person — track membership already proved
# every frame in it is one continuous physical entity, so a handful of
# confirmed matches anchors the rest even where the blurred mean does not.
# This only ever ADDS candidates the mean-only gate would refuse; it never
# removes one, and it needs `obs` (only populated when the pre-pass is asked
# to collect_obs=True — the temporal-detection path). 0 disables it, falling
# back to mean-only exactly as before.
_TRACK_ASSIGN_MIN_OBS = int(os.environ.get('ROOP_TRACK_ASSIGN_MIN_OBS', '3') or '3')


# ROOP_TRACK_VETO=0 disables the veto entirely (pre-fix behavior: a tracked
# source is applied wherever the spatial association points).
# Fraction of a track's frames that must overlap an already-assigned track of the
# same person before the track is treated as a genuinely concurrent second body
# (and so refused that person's source) rather than an occlusion handoff.
_TRACK_OVERLAP_FRAC = float(os.environ.get('ROOP_TRACK_OVERLAP_FRAC', '0.15'))


# ── Second-and-later track per person ────────────────────────────────────────
# A person may legitimately own SEVERAL tracks: tracking fragments constantly
# (a 23k-frame clip produced 60-130 tracks), so the assignment binds every
# track under _TRACK_ASSIGN_MAX, refusing only those that run CONCURRENTLY with
# a track the person already owns (_TRACK_OVERLAP_FRAC — one person cannot be in
# two places at once).
#
# The contrapositive does not hold, and that was the hole: a track that does NOT
# overlap is not thereby the same person. A bystander's track fragment that
# happens to lie entirely in a stretch where the target is OFF SCREEN is disjoint
# from every track the target owns, so the concurrency guard has nothing to say
# about it, and an absolute gate cannot separate "target on a bad stretch" from
# "different person who scrapes under 0.6". The bystander inherited the target's
# source for exactly the frames the target was absent — the reported "when the
# target is not in the frame, the other face gets swapped".
#
# So a person's FIRST (closest) accepted track sets the anchor, and every later
# one must land within this margin of it. That is the measurement that separates
# them: the target's own fragments cluster around its anchor (measured 0.36 /
# 0.361) while a stranger squeaking under the absolute gate sits near it (0.5-0.6).
#
# Cost of being wrong is bounded and one-sided: a refused track is not dropped,
# it just loses identity LOCKING and falls through to per-frame matching at the
# full threshold, so a genuine target fragment still swaps. 0 disables.
_TRACK_ASSIGN_MARGIN = float(os.environ.get('ROOP_TRACK_ASSIGN_MARGIN', '0.15'))


# Floor under the margin above. The margin is relative to the person's best
# track, so an unusually GOOD anchor makes it unusually strict: a clean frontal
# capture matching a clean frontal track can anchor at 0.15, which would then
# refuse that same person's profile-heavy fragment at 0.40 — a distance nothing
# else in the pipeline treats as a stranger. Below this floor the margin never
# binds, so any track this close to the captured person is bound whatever the
# anchor. Typical anchors (0.30-0.40 measured) put the margin at 0.45-0.55
# anyway, so this only takes effect at the good end, and it stays well clear of
# the 0.5-0.6 band where the bystander tracks that motivated the margin sit.
# It matters most alongside _TRACK_REID_MAX, which deliberately trades a tighter
# Re-ID for MORE fragments — each of which then has to pass this gate.
_TRACK_ASSIGN_FLOOR = float(os.environ.get('ROOP_TRACK_ASSIGN_FLOOR', '0.45'))


# ── Stitching fragments back together ────────────────────────────────────────
# Every gate above judges a track on its MEAN EMBEDDING against the captured
# stills, and that comparison has a floor set by something nothing in this file
# can fix: for the same person, a profile sits 0.7-1.0 in cosine distance from a
# frontal capture, which is past every gate here and past the per-frame fallback
# too. So a stretch of turned or occluded frames does not merely score badly —
# it breaks ASSOCIATION during the scan (EMB_MAX 0.7), becomes a track of its
# own, and that fragment is then judged on a mean built entirely from the frames
# that broke it. Measured on the clip this was reported from: 15 tracks over 287
# scanned frames, 2 of them matched to a source, 56% of all detected faces left
# un-swapped. That is the "enormous flicker when something crosses the face at a
# lateral pose" — the swap is off for whole stretches, not single frames.
#
# The link that survives what appearance cannot is SPATIO-TEMPORAL: a track that
# ends here and another that begins a moment later, in the same place, at the
# same size, is one person interrupted. So fragments are chained on geometry
# before any of the identity gates run, and appearance is demoted to a veto for
# the clearly-impossible. A chain's mean is then built over both segments, which
# is also a better estimate than either had alone.
#
# It is deliberately one-to-one and refuses ambiguity: a fragment with two
# plausible predecessors is left alone rather than guessed at, because the cost
# of a wrong link is a stranger inheriting a swap for a stretch, while the cost
# of a missed link is what the pipeline already does today.
#
# ROOP_TRACK_STITCH=0 disables it entirely.

# ── Judging a leftover fragment against the TRACK instead of the photo ───────
# Every gate above compares a track's mean to the CAPTURED STILLS, and that
# comparison has a floor nothing can lower: the same person's turned or
# badly-lit stretch sits 0.7-1.0 from a frontal capture. Measured on the clip
# this came from — one target, one bystander, 717 frames:
#
#   track  0   715 frames   0.27  -> source 0
#   track  2   133 frames   0.72  -> refused, over the 0.60 gate
#   track  1   715 frames   1.05  -> refused (the other person)
#   tracks 3,6,8,9,10       0.93-1.07 -> refused
#
# Track 2 is 19% of the clip sitting in the band where a person's own bad
# stretch lives, thrown away while the bystander sat 0.33 further out. No
# threshold fixes that: 0.72 against a PHOTOGRAPH is genuinely ambiguous.
#
# It is not ambiguous against the TRACK. Comparing a fragment to one that ran
# through the same clip — same camera, same lighting, same grade, and a mean
# averaged over many poses rather than a handful of captured angles — is a far
# better posed question, and it is the comparison nobody was making.
#
# Applied only to tracks the first pass REFUSED, only against a track that pass
# accepted, and still subject to the exact concurrency check. 0 disables it.
_TRACK_INHERIT_MAX = float(os.environ.get('ROOP_TRACK_INHERIT_MAX', '0.6'))

# ...and the gate that makes it safe, which an absolute bar cannot be.
#
# A stranger sitting 0.55 from the captured person is indistinguishable from the
# target on a bad stretch BY DISTANCE ALONE — that ambiguity is exactly what
# _TRACK_ASSIGN_MARGIN exists to refuse, and a second pass with a looser absolute
# bar would hand the stranger the swap all over again (it did: the guard test for
# that reported bug failed the moment this was added).
#
# What separates them is not how close the fragment is to the track, but whether
# the TRACK EXPLAINS IT BETTER THAN THE PHOTO DOES. The target's turned stretch
# is far from a frontal capture and near its own frontal track — a large gain.
# A stranger is equally far from both, because the assigned track IS the person
# in the photo — no gain, whatever the absolute numbers happen to be.
#
# So inheritance requires the improvement, not just the proximity. On the
# reported clip that is 0.72 against the stills versus a track distance that has
# to beat 0.57 to count; on the bystander fixture it is 0.55 against 0.55, which
# gains nothing and is refused.
_TRACK_INHERIT_GAIN = float(os.environ.get('ROOP_TRACK_INHERIT_GAIN', '0.15'))


# The OTHER justification for inheriting, for the shape the gain above cannot
# reach: a track that is disjoint from the one it would inherit from because it
# belongs to a different SHOT.
#
# The gain test asks "does the track explain this better than the photo?", which
# works when the photo is a fair description of the person. Across a cut it is
# not: a close-up profile is far from a frontal still AND somewhat far from the
# wide-shot track, so the gain is small even though the answer is obvious. What
# is decisive there is the comparison BETWEEN the selected people. Measured over
# the 15 tracks of the reported clip (two people, one frontal capture each):
#
#   same person, different shot     0.11 - 0.68     (track to track)
#   different people                0.85 - 1.08
#   the same tracks against the PHOTO   0.17 - 1.05  — straddling the 0.60 gate
#
# — a clean gap with nothing in it, against a photo comparison that has no gap
# at all. The smallest correct margin (this person's nearest track versus the
# nearest track of anyone else) was 0.32; 0.25 sits under that and far above the
# 0.0 an ambiguous track produces.
#
# REQUIRES AT LEAST TWO SELECTED PEOPLE, and that is not a detail. With one
# person there is nobody to be further from, the margin is vacuous, and what is
# left is a bare absolute bar on a disjoint track — precisely the bystander that
# _TRACK_ASSIGN_MARGIN and the containment rule were added to refuse. With one
# person selected this path does not exist and nothing changes.
_TRACK_INHERIT_MARGIN = float(os.environ.get('ROOP_TRACK_INHERIT_MARGIN', '0.25'))


# ── Assign-by-elimination for exactly two selected people ───────────────────
# Sustained close contact (measured on d2.mp4, roop-recode session 3 — two
# people kissing for most of a 155s clip) can make appearance matching
# unreliable for BOTH people at once, not just the contaminated frames: the
# clip's single biggest track (46% of it) sat 0.63/0.89 from the two captured
# photos — over the gate for both, and not close enough to trust the smaller
# one either, even though it is unmistakably one of the two people on a
# straight watch of the footage.
#
# What IS still reliable there is who else is on screen. With exactly two
# people selected, a track that runs CONCURRENTLY with an already-bound
# track for a real share of its own length cannot be that same person (one
# body, one place) — and with only one other selected person to be, it must
# be them, independent of how noisy its own embedding reads. This is
# deliberately NOT available with one selected person or three+: "the only
# other option" stops being a safe inference the moment there could be a
# bystander instead of the other selected person, which is exactly the
# reasoning _TRACK_INHERIT_MARGIN's two-or-more requirement already uses.
#
# Runs LAST, after the mean gate and inheritance have both had their normal
# chance — it only ever picks up tracks neither of those bound, never
# overrides one. ROOP_TRACK_ELIM_FRAC=0 disables it.
