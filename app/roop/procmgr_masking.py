# in training. Measured on a real clip: at ~-42deg pitch (head tilted sharply
# back), XSeg predicted a "keep original" region covering the entire forehead
# and hairline, leaving only a small eyebrows-to-mouth island actually swapped
# — the un-swapped forehead then shows through, which reads as "the swapped
# face is small". This is a mask-model generalisation gap, not an alignment
# bug: the aligned crop itself is geometrically correct (a similarity
# transform cannot distort it — see the anisotropy note above), only the
# LEARNED segmentation is unreliable at this pose.
#
# Fix is a sanity check against known-good geometry, not a different mask
# model: the 5 keypoints, warped through the SAME M that built this crop, are
# exactly where the face's core features actually landed for this face this
# frame — accounting for whatever residual the alignment fit itself has, which
# matters most exactly on the degenerate poses this targets. A face-oval
# built from them is a hard floor of "this is definitely face" that any
# correct mask should already cover. Only widens the swap region — where the
