# retinaface_r50 @640) — paid on every frame of every clip, to answer a question
# that on ordinary footage has the same answer every time.
#
# Why not simply drop it: on a head rolled between ~140 and ~220 degrees the 5
# keypoints are up to 172 degrees wrong while looking entirely healthy, and
# nothing derivable from them separates that from an upright face (four
# candidate discriminators were measured and all overlap — see _axis_from_68).

    `_rescue_rotated` already turns the frame when the upright pass finds
    NOTHING. This is the other half, and it is the one that matters on an
    inverted face: the detector does not fail there, it succeeds badly. On a
    frontal head rolled 180 it reports 0.98 confidence and keypoints that are
    labelled correctly but geometrically crushed — measured against ground
    truth (the roll-0 keypoints carried by the same warp), interocular collapses
    177 -> 136px and eye->mouth 202 -> 134px, putting the mouth corners 0.45
    interocular out of place.

    Two things read those keypoints, and both break:

      * RECOGNITION. `norm_crop` fits them to the arcface template, so a
        crushed pair of eyes over-zooms the crop and pushes the mouth out of
        frame. The embedding of an inverted face then scores ~0.0 cosine
        against the SAME PERSON upright, where two different people score
        0.128 — below the cross-identity floor. Downstream that is
        "the upside-down face is not recognised as the selected target and is
        never swapped", and it also splits one continuous face into two tracks,
        which in turn breaks the roll latch's continuity.
      * ALIGNMENT. `align_crop` fits the same points, so the swapped crop is
        mis-scaled and off-centre.

    Turning the frame upright first fixes both at the source: re-detected on an
    uprighted frame the same face scores 1.000 against its upright self at
    EVERY roll angle. The embedding computed there is already the one we want,
    and it survives the coordinate mapping untouched because it is not a
    coordinate. Only bbox/kps/landmarks need carrying back.

    Guarded by the same outcome test the autorotate path uses, measured BEFORE
    the coordinates are mapped back (afterwards the face reads at its original
    roll again, and the test would be meaningless). A turn that did not stand

# ── In-plane roll detection (autorotate_faces) ───────────────────────────────
#
# The decision "is this face lying on its side, and which way do I turn the
# frame to stand it up?" rests entirely on estimating the face's DOWN axis
# (eyes -> chin) in image space.  Which landmarks that axis is built from
# matters far more than it looks, because an out-of-plane turn (yaw) shears
# every candidate axis sideways and so masquerades as in-plane roll.
#
# Measured over a yaw 0-90 / pitch +-30 sweep of the project's own reference
# head (tests/facegeom.py), with the head held perfectly upright — so every
# reading below is pure error:
#
#     eye-midpoint -> NOSE TIP     up to 45.7 deg   unusable
#     eye-line perpendicular       up to 90.0 deg   unusable
#     eye-midpoint -> MOUTH-mid    up to  9.1 deg   good
#
# The nose tip protrudes along +z, so turning the head swings it sideways
# almost as much as a real 45 deg roll would.  The eye line collapses to zero
# length at full profile and its direction becomes noise.  The mouth midpoint
# sits on the head's vertical midline and barely moves — it is the only one of
# the three that stays honest, so it is what is used.
#
# A 90 deg turn of the frame lands the face within 45 deg of upright exactly
# when its roll is between 45 and 135 deg — that is the honest break-even band,
# and the two edges of it want different treatment.
#
# LOWER is pushed out from 45 to 54.5 because the failure directions are not
# symmetric there: declining to rotate a sideways face merely forgoes an
# improvement, while rotating an upright one corrupts the crop the swap is
# built from.  54.5 is not a guess — swept against the same synthetic head, it
# is the first value with ZERO false positives over the full yaw 0-90 /
# pitch +-30 grid at every roll up to 44 deg, while still firing on every face
# in the 70-110 deg band.  Below it the 9.1 deg axis error stacks onto real
# roll and upright faces start getting turned.
#
# UPPER stays at the true break-even 135 and deliberately does NOT inherit that
# margin.  Nothing near 135 deg is at risk of being an upright face, so the
# only thing a margin buys there is lost recall — and it is expensive: a face
# at 120 deg is 90 deg better off for being turned.
#
# Past UPPER a 90 deg turn no longer helps — but a 180 deg one does, and that
# is what the band above it is for.  An inverted face is exactly the case a
# quarter turn cannot reach: at 165 deg either quarter turn leaves it at 75,
# still on its side, while a half turn puts it at -15.  The two branches meet
# without a seam because at exactly 135 deg they are equivalent (both land the
# face at 45), so which side of the boundary a noisy reading falls on does not
# matter.  Nor can the half turn misfire on an upright face: reaching 135 deg
# of measured tilt would take 135 deg of error against a 9.1 deg axis.
FACE_ROLL_LOWER = 54.5          # vs the 9.1 deg worst-case axis error
FACE_ROLL_UPPER = 135.0         # above this a quarter turn stops helping and a half turn starts

    `is_non_frontal`). No threshold on a contaminated scalar can fix that; the
    two angles have to be separated.

def solve_pose_jaw_5pt(kps):
    """(yaw, pitch, roll, jaw) in degrees + jaw fraction, or None.

    Same weak-perspective model as solve_pose_5pt, with the mouth allowed to
    open. That matters because it is not a small correction:

        frontal head, jaw dropping, NOTHING else moving
        jaw drop        0%     15%     30%     45%     60%
        solve_pose_5pt  0.0   -11.0   -18.7   -24.1   -28.0 deg of "pitch"

    A talking head reports up to 28 degrees of pitch that is not there, and
    The projection then places the reference head in a position the person
    is not in — which is worse than not correcting at all. Two consequences, both
    measured on REAL detected keypoints (seven faces from this project's test
    clip, mouth opened synthetically so nothing else changes):

      * The crop breathes. Opening the mouth 45% of the eye-to-mouth distance
        moves the reported pitch by up to 17 deg and swings the crop scale
        1.36x on average, 1.46x worst. With the jaw solved out, the reported
        pitch is constant to 0.1 deg and the swing is 1.03x / 1.06x.
      * The correction fires on faces that have not moved. A frontal head with
        the mouth 45% open reported 24 deg of pitch, which is most of the way
        through the 15->40 deg engagement band, so the template was being
        swapped in on the strength of an expression. It now scores 0 and the
        alignment is bit-identical to leaving the mode off.

    Note what this does NOT claim: on turned heads the correction was mostly
    engaging for real reasons. Across 18 high-angle frames sampled from that
    clip the engagement verdict does not change on any of them, and the pitch
    moves by only a few degrees — those heads really are tilted. The win is
    steadiness across an expression, not a different set of frames.

    WHY A LINEAR SOLVE CANNOT DO THIS, and this one can. After centring, the
    jaw displacement lies EXACTLY in the span of the reference head's own
    coordinates (least-squares residual 4e-16 — see tests/test_open_mouth_pose),
    so adding a jaw column to the linear system changes nothing: both eyes sit
    at one y and both mouth corners at another, and dropping the jaw is a
    reweighting of that axis, which is what pitch is. What breaks the tie is the
    ROTATION CONSTRAINT — a jaw drop leaves a residual no rigid rotation can
    produce. The unconstrained fit answers a jaw drop by stretching the y axis,
    so its two projection rows come out unequal and non-orthogonal; driving that
    inconsistency to zero is a one-dimensional problem in the jaw. Not a convex
    one, though — see _JAW_SCAN_STEP and _JAW_TIE_RATIO for the two basins and
    the genuine yaw-0 ambiguity, which is most of what the code below is doing.

    ACCURACY, and where it is worst. Exact to 0.0000 deg over |yaw| 5-90 x
    pitch +/-40 x roll +/-90 x jaw -0.21..0.74. At |yaw| BELOW about 5 it can be
    wrong by up to 36 deg, because that is where the two readings described under
    _JAW_TIE_RATIO stop being distinguishable — 28 of 9576 grid poses, every one
    of them at yaw 0, half over-reading the pitch and half under-reading it.
    That sounds bad until it is compared with the alternative, which is what
    matters here. Under 0.5 px of keypoint noise on a 180 px face:

        pitch error, mean / p95 / sd across draws
        yaw pitch   solve_pose_5pt          this
          0     0   16.5 / 28.2 / 10.0      0.5 /  1.1 / 0.6
          0    20   22.3 / 39.1 / 13.9      3.3 / 34.6 / 9.0   <- the bad case
          0    40   25.1 / 46.3 / 16.4      6.2 / 12.9 / 5.8
         15    40   24.5 / 45.3 / 16.0      1.5 /  3.9 / 1.8
         60    40   16.5 / 31.1 / 10.9      0.4 /  0.9 / 0.5

    It is better on the mean and on the spread in every condition, including the
    bad one. The spread is the part that shows on video: what reaches the render
    is the engagement weight, and on a STILL head at yaw 15 / pitch 40 (true
    weight 1.0) the jaw-blind pose delivers 0.341 +/- 0.404 — the correction
    fading in and out on a face that is not moving — against 1.000 +/- 0.001
    here. At yaw 0 / pitch 0 (true weight 0.0) it is 0.178 +/- 0.210 against
    0.000 +/- 0.000. Most of what looked like pose-mode flicker was this.

    Costs ~9x solve_pose_5pt (112 us against 13), so it is used only where it
    changes an outcome: the 'pose' and 'stabilize' alignment templates, both
    opt-in. solve_pose_5pt stays the answer everywhere else — the mask router,
    the mouth and eye restore fades, the tracking gates — unchanged and
    bit-exact. Those read pose to decide how far a head has TURNED, where a few
    degrees of jaw-borrowed pitch changes no verdict; the templates are the one
    consumer that projects a head at the angle it is handed.

# ── Did the swap move the face? ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# Threshold in interocular units for how far the swapped face's keypoints may
# sit from the plate's before the swap is discarded.
#
# A swap is image-to-image: the output face belongs where the input face was, so
# this number is tiny for any honest result. Measured on a clip rotating a head
# through a full turn (317 graded frames), keypoint displacement against the
# plate:
#
#   clean frames                 median 0.019   p90 0.056
#   frames the swap wrecks       median 3.752   p10 1.978
#
# — a 35x gap with nothing in between, against a correlation of only 0.46
# between this and yaw, which is exactly why the pose-threshold and
# crop-self-consistency gates both failed: they measured the POSE, and the
# failure is not a pose, it is an outcome. 1.0 sits ~18x above the clean p90 and
# ~2x below the wrecked p10. The 80-88 degree band — real profiles, which swap
# acceptably — sits at 0.340 and is deliberately spared.
SWAP_MOVED_TOL = 1.0


# Second condition, and the one that decides on profile footage: how much the
# keypoint CONSTELLATION changed, after removing translation and normalised by
# its own extent. Displacement alone cannot separate a wrecked swap from a good
# one once the faces are small and turned — measured over 229 correct swaps on
# a two-person contact clip against 148 faces of the yaw +-90 studio sweep:
#
#   displacement > 1.0 (the test above, alone)   discards 28.4% of the CORRECT
#                                                swaps, and 78.4% of the sweep
#                                                — most of which are also fine
#
# because a legitimate swap of a 120px profile moves the five points ~10px, and
# ten pixels over a six-pixel interocular distance is 1.7. The shape term does
# not have that problem: it is scale-free, and it is what physically changes
# when a frontal face is painted onto a head pointing away — the collapsed
# profile constellation is replaced by a spread frontal one.
#
# Measured, same two sets:
#
#   correct swaps (n=229)   max 0.730, p99 0.714, NOTHING above 0.75
#   studio sweep  (n=148)   bimodal: 76 under 0.75 (which look correct in the
#                           contact sheet), a second mode from 1.0 to 4.3 with
#                           doubled mouths and ghosted features
#
# 0.75 therefore sits above every correct swap measured and at the point where
# the picture starts to degrade. Both conditions must hold, so this can only
# ever discard a SUBSET of what the displacement test discarded on its own —
# the existing per-model tolerances (verify_tol_for) keep their meaning.
# ROOP_SWAP_SHAPE_TOL=0 restores the displacement-only rule.
#
# KNOWN LIMIT, stated because it is not obvious from the numbers above. A
# frontal face pasted onto a profile at the SAME orientation and the same
# constellation extent measures 0.706 — below the 0.730 maximum of the correct
# swaps. That particular failure is therefore not separable by this metric at
# ANY threshold, and it is not separable by displacement either without
# discarding a quarter of the correct swaps. It does not appear in the measured
# wrecked set, whose whole mode sits at 1.0+ because the orientation changes
# too, so this is a gap in what the guard can see rather than a regression from
# a rule that used to catch it. ROOP_VERIFY_SWAP=0 turns the guard off entirely
# for footage where even the residual costs more than it saves.
