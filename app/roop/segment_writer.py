"""Crash/abort-resumable video encoding via finalized segment files.

Problem: the in-memory pipeline encodes straight into one long ffmpeg pipe. If
the process dies mid-render (power loss, driver reset, accidental window kill),
the temp file has no trailer (moov atom) and every already-encoded frame is
lost — a 10-hour run restarts from zero.

Fix: SegmentedVideoWriter is a drop-in replacement for FFMPEG_VideoWriter that
rotates the encode into numbered segment files, closing (finalizing) each one
every ROOP_RESUME_CHUNK frames (default 1000) and recording it in a manifest
JSON next to the output. Because each completed segment is a valid playable
file, a crash can only ever lose the in-progress segment. On the next run with
the same source/trim/settings, run_batch_inmem reads the manifest, skips the
already-encoded frames, and continues; when the run completes, the segments are
losslessly concatenated (ffmpeg concat demuxer, stream copy) into the expected
single temp video and cleaned up, so everything downstream (audio restore, the
upscale second pass, template naming) is unchanged.

A deliberate Stop is finalized exactly like a completed run: the segments are
concatenated into the temp video, the parts and manifest are deleted, and
batch_process still mixes the audio back and applies the output template — so
stopping yields one properly named partial video, not a pile of parts. Set
ROOP_RESUME_KEEP=1 to keep the parts after a Stop so it can be resumed later
(a crash never reaches the cleanup, so crash-resume works either way).

Disable with ROOP_RESUME=0. Segment files start with '.' so the output-folder
scans (e.g. the upscale pass's _outputs_since) ignore them.
