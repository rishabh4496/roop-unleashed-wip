"""DeepFaceLab-style merger post-ops, in canonical face-crop space.

DFL's merger has two halves: the models (XSeg, the face nets) and a set of
cheap post-processing knobs applied to the merged crop just before it is pasted
back. This repo ported the models years ago; this module is the other half.

Everything here runs on the aligned crop that is ALREADY in memory at this
point in the pipeline (256-1024px, CPU, numpy/cv2), so none of it touches the
GPU or adds a model to the per-frame path.

Every op is a BIT-IDENTICAL no-op at its neutral value, and `apply_merger_post`
returns its input object unchanged when all of them are neutral. That is the
whole cost story when the features are off: one attribute read each, measured
at 0.00 ms for the whole chain.

These run AFTER the mask engines, on the whole crop — so wherever a mask has
restored original plate pixels (a hand, hair over the face) those pixels get
grain or blur applied on top of grain they already had. DFL's merger behaves
the same way, and at usable strengths the doubled amount over a small occluded
region is not visible, but it is why these are strength sliders rather than
a switch.

Switched ON they are NOT free. Measured on a 512x512 crop, one face, CPU:

    sharpen      0.6 ms      degrade      0.8 ms
    hist_match   5.0 ms      grain_match  6.8 ms
    motion_blur  7.5 ms      all five    15.3 ms

Which is the same order as a mask-engine model call (2-6 ms) and about one
GPEN-512 (18 ms) for the full set — worth knowing before enabling all of them
on a long render, and worth re-measuring with ROOP_PROFILE=1 on real footage
rather than trusting the table. They are CPU work in a GPU-bound pipeline, so
with threads > 1 some of this overlaps rather than adding end to end; that
overlap is the thing the table cannot tell you.

What each knob is for
---------------------
hist_match   Per-channel CDF match toward the original crop. A fourth colour
             family alongside rct/lct/mkl: those match moments, this matches
             the whole distribution shape, which is what catches a face that
             is subtly flatter or more contrasted than the plate.
sharpen      Signed unsharp mask. Positive sharpens; NEGATIVE softens, which
             is the "denoise" direction — DFL ships those as two separate
             powers, but one signed control is the same two behaviours without
             the redundant third slider. (DFL's own denoise uses non-local
             means, which is tens of ms; a blend toward a Gaussian is not.)
motion_blur  A pin-sharp face on a head that the camera smeared is one of the
             loudest tells in a moving shot. Direction is measured FROM THE
             PLATE rather than asked for: motion blur destroys detail along
             the axis of travel, so the structure tensor's weak eigenvector
             points along it.
grain_match  The opposite tell, and the more common one: the generator emits
             clean skin, so on grainy or compressed footage the face reads as
             pasted precisely BECAUSE it is cleaner than everything around it.
             Measures the plate's noise floor and puts that much back.
degrade      Bicubic down-and-up. Matches a soft or heavily compressed plate
             that a sharp 512px swap does not belong in.
