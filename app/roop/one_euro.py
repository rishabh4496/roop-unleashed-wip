"""One Euro filter for temporal smoothing of face keypoints across video frames.

The One Euro filter (Casiez et al., 2012) is an adaptive low-pass filter: it
smooths heavily when the signal is slow/still (kills detector jitter) and lightly
when the signal moves fast (avoids lag), so it beats a fixed-alpha EMA's single
jitter-vs-lag tradeoff.

Time `t` here is a monotonically increasing per-frame index (dt = 1 frame), so
`min_cutoff` / `beta` are expressed in per-frame units.

# Warm-up frames needed before a filter's seed stops showing in its output.
#
# Parallel stabilization splits a clip into contiguous blocks and gives each
# block its own filter, seeded from the first frame it sees rather than from the
# true history. Every one of these filters is an EMA
# (`out = a*x + (1-a)*prev`), so that wrong seed decays geometrically: after W
# frames its weight is exactly (1-a)^W. Priming each block with W frames it then
# discards is what makes a block boundary seam-free — and W is not a taste
# parameter, it is fixed by `a` and the error you are willing to leave behind.
#
# A single hardcoded W cannot be right for every setting: `a` is derived from
# the smoothing strength the user chose, and it varies enormously.
