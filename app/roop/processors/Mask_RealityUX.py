# Classes BiSeNet is allowed to subtract from XSeg's swap region: only
# unambiguous, OPAQUE non-face regions -- background(0), ears(7,8,9),
# cloth(16), hair(17), hat(18). Deliberately narrower than "everything not in
# _FACE_CLASSES" (the first version of this fusion): that complement also
# included glasses(6) and neck(14,15), both measured to cause real harm --
#   - glasses(6): BiSeNet labels the ENTIRE lens area as glasses, including
#     the eye visible through a translucent lens, not just the frame/rim.
#     Excluding it means the eye under the glasses never gets swapped at all,
#     showing the ORIGINAL person's eye/eyeliner through the tint instead of
#     the faceset's -- measured directly on s4.mp4 (t=0.327s): a heatmap diff
#     against XSeg-alone showed the swap's only real divergence anywhere in
#     the frame was concentrated exactly on the lenses, and the RealityUX
#     side showed a distinctly different (sharper, un-swapped-looking)
#     eyeliner shape there. Requirement: swapped eyes must always be the
#     faceset's own, never the original's, even under glasses.
#   - neck(14,15): the neck/jaw boundary is genuinely ambiguous at extreme
#     poses (chin tucked, head tilted back) and BiSeNet mislabels real jaw/
#     cheek skin as neck there -- confirmed via the raw label map on s4.mp4's
#     backward-tilt pose (t~119.5s).

    confident are definitely not part of the face -- background, ears, cloth,
    hair, hat (see `_NONFACE_STRICT`; glasses and neck are deliberately NOT
    in this set, see below). It never expands what XSeg already swaps, and it
    never second-guesses XSeg inside the core skin/eyes/nose/mouth
    area.

    First version of this fusion combined the two engines as a straight
    intersection of their swap regions (`np.maximum` of both "keep original"
    masks, the same way this codebase already unions two auxiliary occlusion
    engines elsewhere). Measured WORSE identity transfer than XSeg alone on
    real footage: the original person's cheek/jaw/lip shape bled through
    wherever BiSeNet's tighter per-part boundaries were stricter than XSeg's
    blob -- not just at the outline, but inside the interior of the face,
    which defeats the point of a face swap. BiSeNet's boundaries are precise
    for excluding hair/ears/glasses/neck; they are not a better authority
    than XSeg for "is this pixel part of the swappable face," which is what
    an intersection implicitly asked it to be.

    Both engines share the same output convention (1.0 = keep the original
    pixel, 0.0 = use the swapped pixel), so no polarity conversion is needed
    -- XSeg's mask and BiSeNet's "definitely not face" mask are combined with
    a plain `np.maximum`, which can only ever exclude MORE than XSeg alone,
    never less. XSeg's own occlusion handling (hands, objects) is preserved
    automatically: wherever XSeg already says "keep original," `maximum` with
    anything can't undo that.
