            # was never shared and only the TensorRT context needs isolating.

            # 4 contexts, each one actually run (see the trap below):
            #
            #   RestoreFormer++   3345 MB   (683 MB per extra context)
            #   CodeFormer fp16   2763 MB   (530 MB per extra context)
            #   CodeFormer fp32   2700 MB   (560 MB per extra context)
            #
            # So BOTH tiers here are cheaper than RestoreFormer++, which has
            # always pooled 4. Pooling this one is not a new risk; it is less
            # than the risk already shipped as the recommended enhancer.
            #
            # Note fp32 is not the expensive tier — it is marginally cheaper.
            # The ONNX file sizes (359 MB fp32 vs 180 MB fp16) do NOT predict
            # VRAM, because 'mixed' has TensorRT build FP16 kernels from either
            # set of weights: what lives on the card is the engine, not the
            # file. Do not re-derive this budget from model file sizes.
            #
            # The trap, if these are ever remeasured: creating a session is not
            # what allocates the execution context. Measured without running an
            # inference, every extra context looks like 10 MB and the whole
            # question looks free.
            #
            # trt_precision 'fp32' is NOT covered by the above — that builds
            # genuinely FP32 engines and was not measured. The fallback below is
            # what carries that case.
            #

            # config the VRAM tier did not anticipate — a big swapper, an
            # expression pool and four restorer contexts all want the same
            # 12GB. An OOM here must not take the render down, because the
            # single-session path is right there and works: on failure, drop
