"""Expression restorer — put the TARGET's expression back onto the swapped face.

Why this exists
---------------
Identity swappers take a crop that carries the expression and an identity vector,
and the generator regresses toward the mean expression of its training set. The
further an expression is from that mean — a wide laugh, crying, a grimace — the
harder it is compressed. Face restorers then push further toward a clean,
neutral face prior. Nothing in that chain is trying to preserve *how open the
mouth is*, so swapped faces come out stiff.

LivePortrait's implicit-keypoint representation separates a face into a canonical
shape, a head pose, and an *expression deformation*. That last term is exactly
what the swap flattened, and it can be read off the original target frame and
re-applied.

Expression-only transfer
------------------------
The usual LivePortrait use is animating a still from a different driving video,
which needs pose transfer, relative-motion handling and a first-frame reference.
None of that applies here: the "source" (swapped crop) and the "driving"
(original target crop) are the SAME frame in the SAME aligned crop space, so the
head pose, scale and translation already match. Only the expression differs.

So instead of replacing the pose, keep it and substitute just the expression:

    x_s     = scale_s * (kp_s @ R_s + exp_s)   + t_s
    x_drive = scale_s * (kp_s @ R_s + exp_mix) + t_s
    exp_mix = exp_s + strength * (exp_d - exp_s)

which reduces to

    x_drive = x_s + scale_s * strength * (exp_d - exp_s)

The rotation cancels out of the *difference*, so the transfer cannot introduce
pose drift even if the head-pose estimate is noisy — the only thing moving is the
expression delta. strength = 0 returns x_s exactly, i.e. a no-op.

exports, which suit this project's onnxruntime/TensorRT stack.

    So: keep TensorRT if present, otherwise fall back to CPU, and never leave
