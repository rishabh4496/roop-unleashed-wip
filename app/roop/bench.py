"""What a frame actually costs on THIS machine, measured on the pipeline's own models.

The point of this file is to answer, per device, the questions the perf settings
ask and nobody can answer from a spec sheet: how many worker threads, how wide
each TensorRT pool, TensorRT or CUDA, NVDEC or cv2, which encoder preset.

It replaces a benchmark that answered none of them. That one ran

    a = torch.randn((T, 3, 512, 512), fp16); torch.matmul(a, a.transpose(-1, -2))

in ONE thread, called `T` "threads", and reported `T / elapsed` as "FPS". `T` was
a batch dimension, so the number it maximised was batched-matmul efficiency —
which is why it read 18,698 "FPS" on an RTX 4070 whose real swap throughput is
single-digit fps, and why it rose monotonically to whatever the largest candidate
was. Nothing in it touched onnxruntime, TensorRT, a pool, a worker thread, or any
model this app runs, and its VRAM guard read `torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()`,
which cannot see an onnxruntime allocation at all and therefore reported ~0.06 GB
while TensorRT held gigabytes. Its output was nevertheless wired straight into
`Settings.resolve_threads`, so it was setting `execution_threads` for real runs.

What this one measures instead:

  * the REAL models the current settings select — the selected swapper (at its
    real tile count for the selected pixel-boost size), the selected enhancer,
    the selected mask engine(s), the selected detector plus the aux models that
    run per face, the expression restorer;
  * built through the app's OWN provider rules, including the two places the app
    deliberately forces FP32 under TensorRT (swapper, GPEN) and the places it
    removes the TensorRT EP entirely (SAM masks, frame upscaler). Timing a model
    under a configuration the app never runs is flattering and useless;
  * concurrency the way the pipeline actually gets it — N independent sessions
    leased one-per-thread (`SessionPool`), which is the ONLY thing that makes
    TensorRT concurrent, against the global lock that serialises every stage
    that has no pool;
  * VRAM through `torch.cuda.mem_get_info`, which sees the whole device;
  * and a composite frame — detect, swap x tiles, enhance, mask, plus the real
    CPU-side align/paste — swept over thread counts, because the thread count
    that wins is the one where CPU work of one frame overlaps GPU work of
    another, and neither half alone can tell you where that is.

Two honest limits, stated here so they are not discovered later:

  * inputs are synthetic tensors of the models' declared shapes. Convolutional
    cost is data-independent, so per-call GPU time is right; what synthetic input
    cannot reproduce is detector POST-processing, which scales with how many
    faces are found. The detect stage is therefore modelled as detector net +
    `faces_per_frame` x (recognition + landmarks), which is where its GPU time
    goes, and the decode/NMS remainder is part of the measured CPU term.
  * the composite is a frame's WORK, not a full render: it excludes the tracking
    pre-pass, colour transfer, stabilisation and the writer. It is a thread-count
    experiment, and the thread count is what it is used for. Absolute fps from it
    will be higher than a real render's.

Standalone (prints the same report the UI renders, off the same config.yaml —
see `bootstrap_globals`, without which this path silently measures the DEFAULT
models instead of the selected ones):

    """The cheapest encoder that can keep up — not the fastest one measured.

    Encoding is NOT a separate pass: `ProcessMgr.write_frames_thread` streams
    frames into a live `FFMPEG_VideoWriter` while the swap is running. So an
    encoder that is already faster than the pipeline produces frames buys
    nothing in wall clock, and the fastest encoder measured here is the one that
    costs the most per frame stored — on the reference machine `hevc_nvenc p5`
    ran 170 f/s against libx265 medium's 42.5, for a file **15x larger** on the
    same 60 frames (1.5 MB against 0.10 MB).

    Ranking by fps alone therefore recommends a large quality-and-size cost for
    a speedup the render cannot use. What the report is really being asked is
    "can the writer keep up, and if not, what is the cheapest thing that can".

    So the PRESET moves first and the codec only if it has to. A faster
    libx264/libx265 preset at a fixed CRF is quality-neutral by construction —
    rate control holds perceptual quality constant, so the preset trades encoder
    search time for a slightly larger file and nothing else — which makes the
    output size an honest cost within one codec. Across codecs it is not: CRF 18
    does not mean the same thing to x264 and to x265, so "libx264 medium is
    0.20 MB against libx265 faster's 0.40" compares two different qualities and
    must not decide anything. The configured codec is therefore kept whenever
    any of its presets clears the bar.

    Only when no preset of the configured codec can keep up does the codec move,
    and then to the fastest thing measured — usually NVENC, which is also the
    right answer there for a second reason: it runs on the GPU's dedicated
    encode engine, off the cores the worker threads are competing for.

    """Load config.yaml into `roop.globals` when nothing else has.

    Every stage in the catalogue is chosen off `roop.globals.CFG` and built with
    `roop.globals.execution_providers`. Under the UI both are already populated —
    `core.run` assigns CFG and `ui.main` resolves the provider — so the benchmark
    the panel starts measures what the user renders with.

    Imported standalone, neither is set. CFG then falls back to a fresh Settings
    (its DEFAULTS: inswapper, SCRFD, no enhancer) and the provider list is empty,
    which is read as CPU. Measured here before the fix: the CLI reported
    "providers: CUDAExecutionProvider, CPUExecutionProvider (config: /)" and
    benchmarked `inswapper @128` + `SCRFD det_10g` while config.yaml selected
    tensorrt, hyperswap and RestoreFormer++ — a full report, internally
    consistent, about a configuration this machine never runs. That is the same
    trap the file's opening docstring is about, one layer up: not a fake
    workload this time, but real models that are the wrong ones.

    `CFG is None` is the signal, and the only reliable one: `execution_providers`
    is NOT empty when unresolved — `roop/globals.py` initialises it to
    `['CUDAExecutionProvider', 'CPUExecutionProvider']`, so a truthiness check
    there passes on a process that has configured nothing, which is how the CPU/CUDA
    pair above got reported as if it were a setting. CFG genuinely defaults to None
    and is assigned in exactly one place (`core.run`), so it separates "the app
    booted" from "this module was imported" cleanly.

    Returns True when it bootstrapped, False when the app had already done it.
