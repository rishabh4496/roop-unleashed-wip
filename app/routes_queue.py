"""Server-side batch queue.

The queue used to live entirely in the browser: a `useState([])` in FaceSwap.jsx
whose runner effect POSTed /api/swap job by job. That meant the queue was only
as durable as the tab. A reload, a Pinokio tab switch, or a closed window lost
every remaining job — silently, mid-batch, after possibly hours of rendering.
Every other piece of long-lived UI state (timeline markers, profiles, grid
selections) already survived a reload; the queue, the longest-lived state in the
app, was the one thing that did not.

So the queue lives here instead:

  * the job list is persisted to app/queue.json after every mutation, so it
    survives a browser reload AND an app restart;
  * the runner is a daemon thread in this process, so a batch keeps going with
    no browser attached at all.

The browser is now a view onto this: it polls /api/queue and renders what it
finds. It no longer decides anything.

WHAT A JOB CARRIES
------------------
`payload` is the exact body the client would have POSTed to /api/swap. Keeping
it verbatim rather than re-deriving it here means the queue path and the single
-run path send byte-identical requests, so a new setting cannot reach one and
miss the other — the drift that hand-maintained payload copies always produce.

The runner supplies only what it alone knows: `target_index`, resolved from
`target_name` at dispatch time. Resolving by NAME is deliberate — a stored index
goes stale as soon as a target is removed after queueing, and the job then
silently swaps the wrong file.
