"""Parallel stabilization must derive its warm-up, not guess it.

Splitting a clip into contiguous blocks and giving each its own smoothing filter
is only output-equivalent to running the clip in order if each block first
discards enough frames to forget the seed it was primed with. Every stabilizer
here is an EMA (`out = a*x + (1-a)*prev`), so the seed's weight after W frames is
exactly (1-a)^W — the warm-up is a solved quantity, not a taste parameter.

The old code used a fixed 4 for every configuration. `a` is derived from the
smoothing strength the user picked, so that was only ever right at the weak end:

    strength   a        (1-a)^4     needed for <=1%
      0.00     0.725      0.57%           4
      0.50     0.580      3.10%           6
      0.75     0.430     10.57%           9
      1.00     0.112     62.28%          39

At strength 1 — the setting that asks for the MOST smoothing — 62% of the seed
survived to the first kept frame of every block, i.e. a visible step at every
boundary. These tests pin the derivation and the two edges that decide whether
parallel stabilization may run at all.

one_euro imports only math + numpy, so the filter half runs functionally. The
scheduler half is checked against source, like test_detector_pools, because
importing ProcessMgr pulls torch (~4s).
