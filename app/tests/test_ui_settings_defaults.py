"""Every setting the Settings panel binds must be a real key in settings.py.

The panel's controls are wired through `bind('key')` / `bindToggle('key')`,
which hands a control four things at once: its value, its change handler, its
"changed from default" marker and its reset. That is a nice consolidation, and
it has one sharp edge — the key is now a string in exactly one place, and a
typo in it fails silently in a particular way:

  * `p['typo']` is undefined, so the control falls back to its literal default
    and looks completely normal.
  * `'typo' in defaults` is false, so `isModified` returns false. The control
    can never be marked as changed and its reset never appears.
  * `set('typo', v)` writes a key the backend drops on the floor, because
    save_settings only assigns keys that already exist on CFG. The control
    appears to work, and the value is gone on the next reload.

Nothing errors at any point. So this test pins the string set against the
defaults the backend actually declares.

It also checks the reverse for the theme keys specifically: those are written
through `setMany` rather than `bind`, and they must be persisted by save(), or
a custom theme survives until the next restart and then vanishes.
