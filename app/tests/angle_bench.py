"""Angle bench — measure what the swap does to a face as the head angle changes.

Not a unit test. It needs the GPU, the model files and a real swap, so it lives
beside surface_snapshot.py as a tool rather than under the unittest run.

The sweep is built from two facesets that are already matched 5-pose yaw sweeps
of one person under studio light (-90, -45, 0, +45, +90). One is the target
plate, the other the source, and the pair is graded both ways round. On top of
the real yaw the plates carry, each plate is rolled in-plane 0..260 degrees,
which is the axis the detector and autorotate actually see.

WHAT IT MEASURES, and why these three:

  drift      Re-detect the face in the SWAPPED frame and measure how far each
             feature group (eyes / nose / mouth / brows / jaw) sits from where
             it sat in the plate, in units of the plate's own interocular
             distance. A swap must not MOVE the features; "the nose and mouth
             do not line up" is precisely this number.

             An identity swap moves them a little by construction — a different
             face is a different shape — so the number to read is drift(angle)
             against drift(frontal) FOR THE SAME PAIR. The frontal value is the
             floor, not zero. Reporting a raw drift as if zero were the target
             is the easiest false flag available here, so the CSV carries both
             the raw value and the ratio to that pair's own frontal value.

  identity   Cosine of the swapped face's embedding against the source faceset,
             and against the plate. Catches the opposite failure: features
             perfectly in place because the swap quietly withdrew and left the
             original face standing. A drift number alone cannot tell a good
             swap from no swap at all.

  ghost      Edge energy inside the feature regions against the plate's. Two
             differently-shaped faces cross-dissolved superimpose two sets of
             features, and the extra edges show up in this ratio before anyone
             can put words to the picture. This is the documented signature of
             the off-axis fade, so it gets its own column.

A detection miss on a swapped frame is recorded as a failure row, never
skipped. A face the detector can no longer find is the worst outcome available
and silently dropping it would flatter the run.
