"""Two people, two facesets, faces that touch — the repro bench.

The reported failure ("both faces flicker, go unswapped, or swap into each
other, but ONLY while the two people are close or touching") needs a clip where
two DIFFERENT selected persons interact, each bound to its own source faceset.
Neither existing video bench can produce it: angle_video and frontal_roll_video
both swap a single face.

What it does, in the order the app does it:

  1. ingest two .fsz facesets from the library exactly as source_gallery does;
  2. capture one target face per person from a frame where the two heads are
     clearly APART (the identity the whole run is judged against must not
     itself come from an ambiguous frame), plus optional extra angles;
  3. run the trimmed clip through `batch_process_with_options` in `selected`
     mode with the tracking pre-pass on — the app's own path;
  4. grade every output frame per person: was that person's face touched at
     all, and does what was pasted look like the faceset that was bound to
     them or like the OTHER one.

GRADING IS PER PERSON AND SIGNED. "It flickered" and "they swapped into each
other" produce the same per-frame difference against the plate, so a bench that
only measures "did this box change" cannot tell them apart. `own`/`other` are
cosine distances from the swapped crop's embedding to each faceset's mean, and
the column that matters is which of the two is smaller.

    `capture_targets` on a single separated frame breaks down on content where
    the two people are never both simultaneously frontal — measured on a
    "neck rotation" exercise clip (d1.mp4, roop-recode session 3) that cycles
    both people through extreme up/down/profile poses for its entire runtime,
    with each person's own frontal-ish close-up occurring at a DIFFERENT time
    than the other's. A single shared capture frame there is a coin flip
    between "both mid-rotation" (which is what the naive picker landed on:
    heads tilted ~90 degrees back) and simply doesn't exist as a good frame at
    all. Independently finding each person's best moment fixed the resulting
    68-70% "not swapped" swap-audit rate to under 20% on that clip.

    Seeds identity from `capture_targets` on `separated_frame`'s pick (so left/
    right person assignment stays anchored the same way), then scans the whole
    video, matches each detected face to whichever seed it's closer to
    (declining anything not clearly one of the two — `max_offaxis_gate` is
    actually a cosine-distance gate despite the name, kept loose since this
    is a coarse "which person" match, not a final identity decision), and
    keeps the lowest off-axis (`solve_pose_5pt` + `offaxis_deg`) frame seen
    for each. A person whose own best frame is no better than the seed simply
    keeps the seed (this never makes the capture worse).

    `seed_frame`: pass an already-located separated frame instead of
    re-deriving one internally. Internally defaults to
    `separated_frame_with_fallback`, not the plain 400-frame `separated_frame`
    — a clip whose two people are never both on screen early (measured on
    d2.mp4, roop-recode session 3, over 3700 frames long) must not hard-fail
    the whole capture over that alone.

    Tried gating candidates on `face_contact.crop_contamination` too (reject
    any touching/contaminated frame outright, no matter its angle) after d9.mp4
    (roop-recode session, baseline_double review) showed its lowest-off-axis
    frame per person was still a contact frame. Measured NET NEGATIVE and
    reverted: on that clip the only "clean" frames the gate accepted were far
    worse references overall (65/59 degrees off-axis, one majority
    hair-occluded) than the contaminated-but-well-posed ones it rejected —
    the actual swap's not-swapped rate got WORSE (35.8% -> 45.4%), not better.
    Off-axis alone, uncorrected, is what's shipped; do not re-add a hard
    contamination gate here without measuring the real swap outcome, not just
    the captured frame's pixels, since a "clean" frame can still be a worse
    reference than a "contaminated" one if its pose/occlusion is bad enough.
