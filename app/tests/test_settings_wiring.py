"""Settings wiring — that a control reaching the UI actually reaches the render.

The recurring failure here is a HALF-WIRED setting: a toggle that appears in the
UI, saves fine, and silently changes nothing, because one of the places it has to
be listed was missed. It has bitten at least twice.

The frontend half is now structural rather than tested: FaceSwap.jsx builds the
request body and the cache signature from one `buildPreviewPayload`, and the
signature IS the request body with the frame coordinates zeroed, so a setting
cannot be sent without being keyed or keyed without being sent.

The backend half cannot be collapsed the same way — `preview()` sets globals
while the run path also passes kwargs — so it is guarded here instead: these
tests read the actual source and assert the two sides agree, with every
exception named and justified rather than merely tolerated.

Source parsing (rather than importing) is deliberate: it works across the
Python/JavaScript boundary and needs no browser or running server.
