"""Per-model tolerance for the swap outcome guard.

face_util.swap_moved_the_face throws away a swap that put the face somewhere
the plate's face was not. Its threshold used to be one shared constant, which
is one too few: how far a CLEAN swap moves the keypoints is a property of the
swapper, and hififace's clean band stops at less than half of where inswapper's
and hyperswap's do (see the measurement table in FaceSwapInsightFace.py). So
hififace now carries its own, tighter value and everything else keeps the
shared default.

Three things have to stay true, and each of them has already been a bug shape
somewhere else in this file's neighbourhood:

  * a model WITHOUT a measured value must fall back to the shared default, not
    inherit whichever model was loaded before it (the same stale-per-processor
    trap `model_has_mask` had);
  * the value must actually reach swap_moved_the_face — a threshold that is
    published, read, and then dropped on the floor is the quiet failure here,
    because the guard keeps working and simply keeps using 1.0;
  * the tolerance must be a REDUCTION. It was introduced from a measurement
    saying hififace trips the guard on frames the others do not, and a value
    above the default would silently invert that.
